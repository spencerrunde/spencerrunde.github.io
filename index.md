# CS 499 ePortfolio: MEAN datatable with CRUD functionality

### Code Review
Watch my Code Review [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q89_3YyGazk) In this code review, I cover existing functionality, analyze my code, and look for areas where I could provide enhancements.

### Enhanced Artifact
You can check out the repo for my enhanced artifact [here.](https://github.com/spencerrunde/CS499Project) The same artifact was used for all three enhancement categories, so you can view the entire project at once.

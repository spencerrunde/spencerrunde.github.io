# Professional Self-Assessment
<p><strong> My Computer Science Journey </strong></p>
<p> Throughout my time at SNHU, I have learned a lot and demonstrated my strengths in several areas. In CS-310, Collaboration and Team Projects, I worked with my entire class in an online Git Repository. Working in a team environment can be difficult, as you have to be careful of code conflicts. Being able to work around this is absolutely essential. This class also taught me about several core Git concepts, such as creating separate branches when creating new features. Many of the projects in DAT-220, Fundamentals of Data Mining, involved creating simple and easy to understand reports for stakeholders. This required taking extremely complicated datasets and diagrams and making them easy to understand for a general audience. The portfolio and associated project that you are currently viewing demonstrates my skills with data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. </p>

<p><strong> Artifact Introduction </strong></p>
<p> My three enhanced artifacts are all part of the same project. They fit together as different pieces of the frontend and backend for this web application, and one would not achieve its desired funtionality without the others. For my software design and engineering enhancement, I have rewritten a program using MongoDB, Express, Node, and Angular. This is known as the MEAN stack, and it is very popular in the field of web development. For my algorithms and data structures enhancement, I added a security algorithm to protect the program from unwanted visitors. Finally, for my databases enhancement, I implemented the ability for users to create, update, and delete entries within the database from the user interface included in the website. These three artifacts were selected specifically because I wanted to show off my skills as a Full Stack developer and take on a larger, more difficult coding challenge than anything I had done before. </p>

# Code Review
<p> Watch my Code Review <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q89_3YyGazk">here.</a> In this code review, I cover existing functionality, analyze my code, and look for areas where I could provide enhancements. </p>

# Enhanced Artifacts
<p> You can check out the repository for my enhanced artifact <a href="https://github.com/spencerrunde/CS499Project">here.</a> Be sure to take a look at the Readme! It will walk you through the process of testing the program on your own system. The same artifact was used for all three enhancement categories, so you can view the entire project at once. Software design and engineering covers the entire project as a whole. Algorithms and data structures covers security, which can be seen in the auth and verifyToken routes, along with several of the frontend files. Databases covers the app's ability to access a MongoDB database and perform CRUD operations on the data held within it. AnimalRoutes on the backend, along with the Create, Read, Update, and Delete components on the frontend showcase this. </p>

# Artifact Narratives
<p> You can find the narrative for each enhancement embedded within collapsible markdown below. </p>

<p><details><summary><strong> Narrative 1, Software design and engineering </strong></summary></p>
  <p><strong> Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </strong></p>
  <p> The artifact that I am enhancing is the final project from CS-340, Client/Server development. This project rendered a dashboard program, which displayed a data table populated with data pulled from a MongoDB database. The language used for this program was Python, and it made use of several python libraries, such as pymongo for database interaction. A simple class containing Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods was imported into the main app for the sake of modularity and reusability. It has been a little less than a year since I initially created this program. </p>

   <p><strong> Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? </strong></p>
   <p> I selected this item in particular because I am focusing on full stack development for my career. This program as a whole was perfect for all three enhancements, as I could recreate and enhance it using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. Doing this showcases my skills in software development, as I had to plan and implement the project structure and solve several logic problems. One big improvement on the artifact is that the app now makes use of responsive design, meaning that it is much easier to view on different screen sizes. Along with this comes a much more user friendly and modern design that conforms to standard web development practices. It is also easier to run the program on different systems, as you do not need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer to do so.

   <p><strong> Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </strong></p>
   <p> I do believe that I did meet the course objects that I had previously laid out. I succeeded in solving a complex problem and implementing its solution to create a fully functional MEAN stack application. I also solved several logic problems while I was working on this enhancement, such as linking the front end client portion of the program with the back end server, and implementing Angular routing. Currently, I have a dead link in the navbar that will allow a user to create an account to log in to the program with. After they have logged in, they will be able to perform CRUD operations on the table and linked database. This security algorithm will be implemented during the next milestone.</p> 

   <p><strong> Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? </strong></p>
   <p> One thing that I discovered was the value of using Postman to test API routes. I wanted to view the enhanced artifact with data actively being populated within the table, so I implemented a portion of the database enhancement early.  Postman allowed me to make sure that all of these routes were working properly, confirming that none of my issues were originating from my API routing. Console logging with another huge help during this process, as I used this to confirm that the front end of the program was successfully receiving the data from MongoDB before I had created the table module. This is also one of the first times that I have undertook a large coding challenge such as this without a guide of some sort to direct me. Not knowing where to start exactly was a challenge, but I conquered this by splitting the program up into several smaller parts and working on them one at a time. A large amount of time was spent doing research and studying documentation for the languages and libraries I was making use of, trying to understand why certain errors were occurring and what the most optimal way to fix them was. </p>

<p><details><summary><strong> Narrative 2, Algorithms and data structure </strong></summary></p>
   <p><strong> Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </strong></p>
   <p> For this milestone, I am again enhancing my final project from the Client/Server Development class, CS-340. This project rendered a simple dashboard, which displayed a table populated with data from a database. Users did not have the ability to do anything other than view the data on the table, but presumably Create, Update, and Delete methods would have been implemented in the future, as these unused methods were included in an imported class. There was no security on this database other than hardcoded MongoDB authorization values, which meant that anyone would be able to perform CRUD operations on the data within the mongo database when the application was pushed onto a server and made live. </p>

   <p><strong> Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? </strong></p>
   <p> I decided to use the same artifact for this milestone because of its lack of security. If the original app were to be deployed to a server online where anyone could access it, there would be no protection against unwanted changes to database entries. The security algorithm that I have implemented fixes this problem. All of the routes for CRUD operations on the backend are protected, as a user must have a valid json web token to access them. Without a proper login, the user will not have a token, and they will not even be able to navigate anywhere on the website, aside from the login and register pages. Once the user has created an account, their login information is sent to a User database, and their password is hashed. Once logged in, they will have a token assigned to their user id. This token is then sent to the backend of the website and verified, which allows for access to the CRUD routes. </p>

   <p><strong> Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </strong></p>
   <p> By successfully implementing this enhancement, I have met several course objectives. Firstly, I have demonstrated my ability to address potential design flaws and eliminate security vulnerabilities in a program. I have also demonstrated my ability to use innovative skills to accomplish my goals, and solve problems relating to algorithms or data structures. In this narrative, I am also demonstrating my ability to communicate my ideas and accomplishments in regards to a fully working product. </p>

   <p><strong> Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? </strong></p>
   <p> The biggest challenge that I faced while working on this enhancement was actually implementing the authentication itself. “Simulating” the login and register methods and routes on the backend was easy enough, but having the frontend work together with the backend was much more difficult. In a previous project, I had made use of the Passport library as a middleware to aid in this process, but I wanted to try a different approach to expand my skills and learn about other methods of accomplishing this. In this project, I created a function that verifies a user’s token as a valid token. This function is called on every route on the backend, which means that without a proper token, disallowed actors cannot access any pages that make use of those routes. Once a user has logged in on the frontend, their token is intercepted using an HttpInterceptor, which then sets their token into the header of their request, which allows the verifyToken function to check it and allow them access. </p>

<p><details><summary><strong> Narrative 3, Databases </strong></summary></p>
   <p><strong> Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </strong></p>
   <p> Finally, the database portion of my artifact was also created for the final project of Client/Server Development, CS-340. To start, Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods were defined in a separate python file, which was then imported into the main Jupyter Notebook ipynb file. Only the Read method was actually implemented, as it was called in order to populate the interactive data table with animal shelter outcome records from a MongoDB database. Since the Create, Update, and Delete methods were never actually used by the program, I decided to have my enhancement focus on implementing them properly. This ended up being much more complex, as I was not simply just connected to a mongo instance and then having the plotly dash library automatically generate a table for me. </p>

   <p><strong> Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? </strong></p>
   <p> I choose the database portion of this project to be included in my ePortfolio because having the ability to interface with and manipulate database information is something that I feel every web developer should have knowledge of. Applications of this include something similar to what I am creating, which could be used to manage records of animals who have visited a vet. Any kind of online shopping platform would need to make use of a database to pull all of their product information from. I upgraded my particular artifact from only being able to Read information from a database to being able to perform every CRUD operation on all data within said database (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). By doing this, I have proved that I have the skills and knowledge necessary to manipulate documents inside of a database and have the changes reflected live to end-users. </p>

   <p><strong> Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </strong></p>
   <p> The course objective that I had set out to meet with this enhancement was as follows: “With these enhancements, I will show how I implement database solutions to solve problems related to storing, accessing, and manipulating data.” I have reached this course objective by successfully creating and implementing CRUD methods for this application. In addition to this, I have also demonstrated the ability to create user interfaces that are simple, effective, and easy to understand and operate. Weaving all of this together with the backend and middleware also shows my understanding of how full stack programs are built. </p>

   <p><strong> Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? </strong></p>
   <p> While I was working on implementing the Create, Update, and Delete methods, I learned a lot about the newest versions of angular and typescript. This was mostly due to Angular’s strict mode, which is enabled by default whenever you create a new angular project through Angular’s cli. Strict mode is meant to guarantee program correctness, so I learned to work with it as opposed to taking the easy route and turning it off. Strict mode does several things, such as requiring you to specify parameter types much more religiously, as function arguments and variables are not allowed to have an implicit “any” type. While working on my Animal class file that defines all of the variables used to fill in the fields of an animal database entry, I learned about definite assignment assertions. For example, “public breed!: string;” is correct, while “public breed: string;” will throw an error. This ensures that every variable is either used in a constructor, or initialized in some other manner. </p>

#### Code Review
<p> Watch my Code Review <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q89_3YyGazk">here.</a> In this code review, I cover existing functionality, analyze my code, and look for areas where I could provide enhancements. </p>

#### Enhanced Artifacts
<p> You can check out the repo for my enhanced artifact <a href="https://github.com/spencerrunde/CS499Project">here.</a> The same artifact was used for all three enhancement categories, so you can view the entire project at once. </p>

#### Artifact Narratives
<p> You can find the narrative for each enhancement embedded within collapsible markdown below in order to prevent the page from becoming too cluttered. </p>

<p><details><summary><strong> Narrative 1, Software design and engineering </strong></summary></p>
  <p><strong> Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </strong></p>
  <p> The artifact that I am enhancing is the final project from CS-340, Client/Server development. This project rendered a dashboard program, which displayed a data table populated with data pulled from a MongoDB database. The language used for this program was Python, and it made use of several python libraries, such as pymongo for database interaction. A simple class containing Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods was imported into the main app for the sake of modularity and reusability. It has been a little less than a year since I initially created this program. </p>

  <p><strong> Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? </strong></p>
	<p> I selected this item in particular because I am focusing on full stack development for my career. This program as a whole was perfect for all three enhancements, as I could recreate and enhance it using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. Doing this showcases my skills in software development, as I had to plan and implement the project structure and solve several logic problems. One big improvement on the artifact is that the app now makes use of responsive design, meaning that it is much easier to view on different screen sizes. Along with this comes a much more user friendly and modern design that conforms to standard web development practices. It is also easier to run the program on different systems, as you do not need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer to do so.

  <p><strong> Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </strong></p>
  <p> I do believe that I did meet the course objects that I had previously laid out. I succeeded in solving a complex problem and implementing its solution to create a fully functional MEAN stack application. I also solved several logic problems while I was working on this enhancement, such as linking the front end client portion of the program with the back end server, and implementing Angular routing. Currently, I have a dead link in the navbar that will allow a user to create an account to log in to the program with. After they have logged in, they will be able to perform CRUD operations on the table and linked database. This security algorithm will be implemented during the next milestone.</p> 

  <p><strong> Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? </strong>
  <p> One thing that I discovered was the value of using Postman to test API routes. I wanted to view the enhanced artifact with data actively being populated within the table, so I implemented a portion of the database enhancement early.  Postman allowed me to make sure that all of these routes were working properly, confirming that none of my issues were originating from my API routing. Console logging with another huge help during this process, as I used this to confirm that the front end of the program was successfully receiving the data from MongoDB before I had created the table module. This is also one of the first times that I have undertook a large coding challenge such as this without a guide of some sort to direct me. Not knowing where to start exactly was a challenge, but I conquered this by splitting the program up into several smaller parts and working on them one at a time. A large amount of time was spent doing research and studying documentation for the languages and libraries I was making use of, trying to understand why certain errors were occurring and what the most optimal way to fix them was. </p>
